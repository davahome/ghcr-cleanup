# ðŸ“¦ Archived

This project is no longer actively maintained.
It was initially created to solve a problem I faced myself - and it worked well enough for that. 
Since then, better and more complete solutions have appeared. If you're looking for a maintained version, check out:

# ghcr-cleanup

A GitHub Action for cleaning up old Containers from ghcr.io

## Notes

This action uses the GitHub API to delete packages. It requires a separate token (optionally delivered as secret). This is due to limitations within GitHub
Actions ([there is no permission "packages: delete"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)).

## Features

**Delete tagged**

This feature is enabled by default. To disable this feature set `delete_tagged: 0`

**Delete untagged**

This feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature set `delete_untagged: 1`

## Parameters

| Parameter                | Feature(s)      | Values                                                                                                                 | Default         |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `token`                  | All             | A valid token with the permissions `delete:packages` and `write:packages`                                              | None (required) |
| `package`                | All             | The name of the package itself (e.g. the `package` of `thedava/example` would be `example`)                            | None (required) |
| `owner`                  | All             | `owner` is either `user` (literally) for personal repos or `orgs/<Your Org name>` for organization repos               | None (required) |
| `delete_tagged`          | Delete Tagged   | Set to `0` to disable deletion of tagged packages                                                                      | `1`             |
| `keep_versions`          | Delete Tagged   | Minimum amount of versions to keep (these are usually the most recent versions - exact order is defined by GitHub Api) | `30`            |
| `minimum_days`           | Delete Tagged   | Minimum age (in days) of a tag to be deletable (younger tags will be skipped)                                          | `14`            |
| `skip_tags`              | Delete Tagged   | A comma separated list of tags to keep (e.g. `latest` or `latest,develop,build-123`)                                   | `latest`        |
| `delete_untagged`        | Delete Untagged | Set to `1` to enable deletion of untagged packages                                                                     | `0`             |
| `keep_versions_untagged` | Delete Untagged | Identical to `keep_versions` but this value is only for the deletion of untagged packages                              | `14`            |

**Restrictions:**

The values for `keep_versions` and `keep_versions_untagged` should not be 100 or greater. Otherwise, this action won't delete anything right now.

## Example

```yaml
name: Cleanup Registry
on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    registry_package:

jobs:
    delete-images:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            -   name: Delete packages older than 14 days (but keep at least 30 versions)
                uses: davahome/ghcr-cleanup@v1.1
                with:
                    # The regular ${{ GITHUB_TOKEN }} is not enough because there is no "packages:delete" permission.
                    # Create a separate token and store it as a secret (see required permissions at the bottom of this README)
                    token: ${{ secrets.DELETE_PACKAGES_TOKEN }}
                    
                    # Define the name of the package (e.g. "thedava/example" would be "example")
                    package: example
                    
                    # Define the owner (it's either literally "user" or "orgs/<Your Org>")
                    owner: user
                    #owner: orgs/davahome -- Use this for organization packages

                    # Configure cleanup of tagged versions
                    minimum_days: 14
                    keep_versions: 30

                    # Configure cleanup of untagged versions
                    delete_untagged: 1
                    keep_versions_untagged: 14
